Android has released many individual privacy features over the past few releases but the existing developer material remains disparate and mainly highlights the breaking changes with every release. As a result, current developer documentation and code snippets are focused on how to adopt individual features and preserve app functionality as developers seek to target the latest SDK.

This codelab will seek to tie individual privacy features together and show the developer how they can learn about their appâ€™s access to private user data and adopt privacy best practices in an existing, running app.
